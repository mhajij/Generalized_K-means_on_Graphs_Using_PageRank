# Generalized k-means on Graphs Using PageRank
Generalized K-means on graph is an algorithm that utilizes centrality measures such as PageRank, harmonic centrality, etc to obtain a k-means-like clustering algorithm on directed and undirected graphs. 


Speifically, on the given graph G, number of clusters k, the algorithm proceeds as described below :

For a given graph G and number of clusters k, the algorithm returns a partition of the graph into k communities as in the following examples :

The above algorithm is applicable to graphs, meshes, point clouds and even metric spaces. In particular, 


* On graphs/meshes : it is precisly given in the psuedocode above.
* On metric spaces : one needs to replace the PageRank by a centrality measure suitable for metric spaces: harmonic centrality only utilizes the metric properties.
* On point clouds : One may define the neighborhood graph on in the input point cloud and then run the above graph-based algorithm given above. The implementation is provided below.

Noice also that Pagerank, considered as a centrality measure, can be replaced by any suitable centrality measure. The script here supports most of the centrality measures given in NetworkX.


The details of the algorithm are described in the paper (Generalized K-means for Metric Space Clustering Using PageRank) :

## Description of the script

The script demonstrated here can be applied to detect communities in graphs or to detect clusters in point clouds.

## Package Requirement

* NetworkX >= 2.0 (Based Graph library)
* scikit-learn >= 0.23.2
* NumPy 

## Getting Started : detecting communities in a complex network 

```ruby
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from graphkmeans import GraphKMeans

# (1) define the graph
G = nx.random_geometric_graph(350, 0.115)

# (2) Run the clustering algorithm
graph_k_means = GraphKMeans(G,k=4,n_iter=10,centrality_method="page_rank")               
d=graph_k_means.fit() # returns a dictionary with keys are nodes of the graph, values are id of the clusters

# (3) plot to inspect the clustering results
draw=graph_parition_plot(G,d)    
draw.draw_graph_partition()

```


### Getting Started : centrality measure-based point clouds clustering

```ruby
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import datasets

from graphkmeans import GraphKMeansOnPointCloud

# (1) define the point cloud

n_samples=700
noise=0.06

X,_ = datasets.make_circles(n_samples=n_samples, noise=noise,factor=.5)  

# (2) Run the clustering algorithm

PCKM = GraphKMeansOnPointCloud(X,k=2,neighbors=5)  
d = PCKM.fit()

# (3) plot to inspect the results

plot_point_cloud(X,d)
```

For example, the algorithm gives the following output on the following point cloud examples :

Note that the clusters obtained cannot be usually obtained using traditional k-means algorithm on point cloud with the usual Euclidean distance (due to the non-convex nature of the domain).



### Using the script for graph clustering 

The algorithm can be utilized to obtain cluster on a given graph. Two main arguments are assumed : the input graph G and the number of cluster k. The following is an example.

```ruby
python main_graphkmeans.py -G data/graph_example.graph -k 4
```

### Using the script for centrality measure-based point clouds clustering

The algorithm can be utlized to obtain a clustering algorithm for point cloud. For instance the following computes the algorithm on 2 centric circles dataset with k=2 and default centrality measure set to PageRank.  

```ruby
python main_pointcloud.py -pc data/circles.npy -k 2 -nbrs 5 
```

Utilizing PageRank as the centrality measure subroutine is fast but it can lead to sub-optimal clustering results. If qualtiy of clusters are disrable then other centrality measures such as harmonic centrality are recommended. The script supports many centrality measures. For instance one can specify harmonic centrality on the moon dataset:  


```ruby
main_pointcloud.py -pc data/moon.npy -k 2 -nbrs 5 -c harmonic_centrality
```
